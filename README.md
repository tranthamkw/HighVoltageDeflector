Schematic for high(er) voltage deflection circuit

Bill of materials is for FIVE sets of deflectors.

update 4/17/24
old design not reliable. texas instruments opamp died in prototype.

new design based on discrete component opamps.

update 4/30/24
schematic, Bill of Materials (BOM), and assembly diagram updated. 
With the present choice of Zener diodes D10 and D6, the maximum voltages are +/- 82V.  This can be increased to +/-100V by updating the zener.  Resistors R27 and R28 will need to be changed to ~1.8k
